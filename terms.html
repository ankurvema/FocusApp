      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or if we discontinue the App. You may stop using the App at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnity, and governing law).</p>
    </section>
